    a <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=define%3Apolymath">polymath</a>, and entrepreneur with a
    penchant for security, design/usability, and above all, usefulness. Check out my
    <a href=./about/>about me</a>, or if you are here for my reading list, check out
    <a href=./books/>my books section</a></p>
