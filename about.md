Thank you for being interested enough in me to dig into my own little corner of the internet. This is my own personal site and as such reflects my own thoughts, ideas, and learning path. I am passionate about efficiency, leadership, and building great things. I have tried to get into writing more, but I rarely make the time for it.

I am currently a "System Operations Manager" at a large, global company. That is short hand for "I build things." I build things for a security and cyber intelligence team within this large, global company. This is my vanity website, this is not my blog. I like to meet interesting people, though I am very much an introvert.
