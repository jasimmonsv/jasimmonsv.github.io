I have always loved books. The feel, the ideal, the smell. I am a minor bibliophile who buys and trades books.
My philosophy on books are pretty simple.
 
1. Never lend a book. If you lend a book to somebody, just expect you will never get it back. #SaveAFriendship
2. A library is not a collection of books you have read, but a collection of knowledge you want. Either for reference, or for life goals, a library is never a trophey room.

Unfortunatly due to my schedule (I hate to word busy), I rarely have down time to sit down and read. Audiobooks are my only recourse while I am doing mindless work like driving. I maintain a book wishlist [here](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/2HYGX5EGMFVPR) and you can follow what I am reading [here](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/2784493-j-a?shelf=currently-reading).

## My philosophy on Reading Books
Books are part and parsel for an educated mind, regardless if it is self-directed, or formed by external factors (e.g., English Lit). I mostly read non-fiction just because there is alot that I still want to learn. But reading fiction is just as important, as it has driven the human conversation for generations. Fiction has played just as big a role , if not bigger, in the evolution of human cultures through references to Romeo and Juliette, or to Machiavelli, or Sinclair's The Jungle. I believe those people that forsake fiction fom non-fiction are missing a huge chunk of knowledge that is just as vital.

With that said, my strategy for choosing a book is very interesting:

1. Does it intrigue me in some way.
2. Is it something I wish to learn.
3. See #1.
